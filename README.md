# Audacity Chapter Labels for Stormlight Archive: Graphic Audio

This year I discovered the [Graphic Audio adaptations of the Stormlight Archive](https://www.graphicaudio.net/the-stormlight-archive-series-set.html).  I've thoroughly enjoyed them so far, though it has bugged me endlessly that the chapters are not marked to match the original texts.  Halfway through The Way of Kings I decided to toss the files into [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) and fix them myself.  I've since done this for Words of Radiance and Oathbringer as well.  Here are my label files if anyone is interested in them.

To use these:

1. Download the label file for your desired part (or copy the contents and paste them into a .txt file).
2. Download your files from Graphic Audio, preferably as MP3 or FLAC.  If you have them as M4B files you will need to convert them to a supported file format; [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/) is free and has this capability.
3. Open Audacity.
4. Drag your files into the Audacity window.
5. If there were multiple files then select all and click Tracks > Align Tracks > Align End to End.
6. Click File > Import > Labels... and select the .txt file from step 1.  
    If done correctly the labels should line up with the desired chapters, though you should check a couple before moving on.
7. Click File > Export Audio and select:
    - A folder to save the new files
    - Export Range: Multiple Files
    - Split files based on: Labels
    - Name files: Using Label/Track name
8. Click Export

When the export finishes you will have a folder of MP3 files, one file per chapter.  You can either listen to them as is or take it a step further and use a program like [AudiobookConverter](https://github.com/yermak/AudioBookConverter) to turn them into an audiobook file with properly marked chapters.

## Special Notes
### Words of Radiance
Chapter 57 is split in half between parts 3 and 4 of the Graphic Audio set.  The labels provided here cut out the closing credits of pt. 3 and opening credits of pt. 4, but the chapter is still split.  If you want to have them on a single track you will need to do some additional editing.

### Oathbringer
For Oathbringer I decided to try putting all 6 parts of the set into a single, large Audacity project.  I apologized for the inconsistency in formatting with the first 2 books in the series.

### Edgedancer, Dawnshard and Rhythm of War
I haven't picked these ones up yet and don't intend to for a while, but I'll add them in when I get around to it.
